# Silkworm

Silkworm is an experimental playground for Ethereum 1x research.
If things go well, it might morph into a grown C++17 Ethereum client with the Apache licence.

# Code Style

We use the standard C++17 programming language.
We follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with the following exception:

* .cpp & .hpp file extensions rather than .cc & .h for C++; .c & .h are reserved for C.
